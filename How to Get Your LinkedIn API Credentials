How to Get Your LinkedIn API Credentials
Getting LinkedIn API credentials is a more involved process that requires creating a developer application and getting the right permissions.

Step 1: Create a LinkedIn Developer Application
Go to the LinkedIn Developer Portal: Navigate to developer.linkedin.com and sign in with your LinkedIn account.
Create an App: Click the "Create app" button. Fill in the required details, such as the app name and your company page (if applicable).
Request Product Access: Once your app is created, go to the "Products" tab. You will need to request access to the following products:
Share on LinkedIn (for posting to a personal profile)
Sign In with LinkedIn (to get your user info)
Marketing Developer Platform (often required for company page posting)
For detailed instructions, follow the official guide: Getting Access to LinkedIn's Marketing APIs.
Step 2: Get an Access Token
Configure OAuth 2.0: In your app settings, go to the "Auth" tab and configure your OAuth 2.0 redirect URLs (e.g., https://www.google.com can work for simple testing).
Generate an Access Token: You need to complete the 3-legged OAuth 2.0 flow to generate an access token. This process involves authorizing your app to access your LinkedIn account.
Required Scopes: When generating your token, you must request the following scopes:
r_liteprofile (to get your Person ID)
w_member_social (to post on your own behalf)
w_organization_social (to post on behalf of a company)
For a step-by-step guide on this flow, refer to the official documentation: LinkedIn's 3-Legged OAuth Flow.
Step 3: Find Your Person ID and Organization ID
Person ID: After getting your access token, you can find your Person ID by making an API call to the /me endpoint.
API Endpoint: https://api.linkedin.com/v2/me
The response will contain an id field (e.g., uXaiQ8Cyu0). This is your Person ID.
See the guide here: Retrieving Member Profiles.
Organization ID: Your Organization ID is the numerical ID of your LinkedIn Company Page. You can usually find this in the URL of your company page's admin view. It is a sequence of numbers (e.g., 104469861).
